## My process

I did a mobile first approach and started with the html and added classes to all elements that I planned to style. I then worked on the css and styled from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add a color to an image when hovering which is something I did not know how to do before without a background-image

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to use absolute and relative positioning

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/-wV4Har4xkQ) - This video helped me learn how to overlay an image with a color.
